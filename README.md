## Randall Team Experimental Page

This is a page for the Randall team to practice using Git/Github workflows for collaborative development and codebase organization.

Members can 

- clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/pattiko-um/pattiko-um.github.io.git`)
- create a new branch (`git checkout -b new-branch`)
- make any changes they like (please don't delete `index.html`), and commit those changes when it makes sense
- push up their modified branch (`git push -u origin` - this simultaneously creates a new remote branch with the same name and pushes the commits on your local branch to it.)
- submit a pull request on Github

After your changes are merged into the `main` branch, they will be live on `pattiko-um.github.io`

### Suggestions

- Add some content to `index.html` with a `<p>` or `<div>` tag
- Make a whole new .html document
- Create a `style.css`, link it in the HTML, and add some styling
- Create a `script.js`, link it in the HTML and add some functionality (even a simple `console.log` just to confirm that it's wired up correctly)
